# Multi-tier-Architecture-Project
A multi-tier architecture, also known as a multi-layer architecture, is a design approach commonly used in software development to create scalable, maintainable, and modular applications. It divides the application into distinct layers or tiers, each with its own set of responsibilities and interactions.
